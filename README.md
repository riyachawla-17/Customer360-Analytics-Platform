## 🧪 Key Components

### 1. 🔬 Sentiment Analysis (Step 5)
- Performed using Azure AI Text Analytics on customer review text.
- Each review is tagged with a sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
- Sentiment score indexed numerically using a UDF in PySpark.

### 2. 🔮 Churn Prediction (Step 6)
- Labels customers as **churned** (1) or **retained** (0) using randomized sampling.
- Features include:
  - Purchase amount
  - Sentiment index
- Trained using PySpark MLlib with a Logistic Regression classifier.
- Accuracy evaluated on test data.

### 3. 📈 Power BI Dashboard (Step 7)
Auto-generated using Microsoft Fabric from the semantic model. Key visuals include:
- Total Customers
- Churn Rate %
- Churn Prediction Breakdown by Location/Product
- Purchase vs Sentiment Comparison

> Note: DAX measures were not manually created due to using the auto-create report option.
